                <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
                <p>Hello! I’m <strong>Praemjith P R</strong>, a passionate learner and creator. I specialize in web design and love building beautiful and functional websites using HTML and CSS.</p>
                <p>I started my journey in technology with a deep interest in how websites work and how users interact with them. This curiosity led me to explore HTML, CSS, and later other web technologies.</p>
                <p>My portfolio reflects a combination of creativity and technical skills, showcasing projects that are both visually appealing and functionally efficient.</p>
                <p>Over the years, I’ve participated in hackathons, technical competitions, and collaborative projects that enhanced my problem-solving skills.</p>
                <p>One of my strongest qualities is adaptability—I enjoy learning new tools and frameworks to keep up with industry trends.</p>
                <p>Beyond coding, I am also interested in design, focusing on creating clean and user-friendly interfaces.</p>
                <p>Collaboration is something I value highly, as I believe great ideas often come from teamwork and diverse perspectives.</p>
                <p>I’m also passionate about personal development and maintaining a positive, growth-oriented mindset.</p>
                <p>Outside the digital world, I enjoy photography, which helps me develop a good eye for composition and detail.</p>
                <p>I believe that every project is an opportunity to learn something new and improve my skills.</p>
                <p>In my future career, I aim to work on projects that make a real difference in people’s lives.</p>
                <p>This portfolio is a reflection of my dedication to the craft and my vision for building impactful solutions.</p>
                <p>I’m always open to connecting with like-minded individuals and potential collaborators.</p>
                <p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I hope you enjoy exploring my work.</p>
